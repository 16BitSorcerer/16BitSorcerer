# Hi there! I'm 16bitSorcerer ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an aspiring developer with a passion for video games, particularly classics like The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Dragoon, and Bloodborne. I'm here to learn, create, and share my journey in the world of software development.

## About Me

I'm a recent graduate with a degree in computer science, eager to plunge into the coding realm and leave my mark. My fondness for analog electronics, nostalgia, and retro gaming has fueled my passion for programming since childhood. As a dedicated fan of vintage technology and classic video games, I'm excited to explore how I can infuse the charm of retro aesthetics into my software projects.

## My Projects

Here are some of the projects you'll find in my repository:
